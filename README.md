Simple script for compiling pandoc markdown to latex

Please note that you must clone the CLS library into a folder called CLSs from git@github.com:citation-style-language/styles.git. Maybe one day I'll make a script that does this automatically.

```
git clone git@github.com:citation-style-language/styles.git CLSs
```
